Python:Dominant Cells
 There is a given list of integers that represent a two-dimensional grid with n rows and m columns. A cell is called a dominant cell if it has a strictly greater value than all of its neighbors. Two cells are neighbors when they share a common side or a common corner. So a cell can have up to 8 neighbors. Determine the number of dominant cells in the grid. So the function description. Complete the function numCells in the editor below. numCells has the following parameters. int grid of n, m, a two-dimensional array of integers, returns int, the number of dominant cells in the grid. The constraints n should be less than or equal to n, and m should be less than or equal to 500. There are at least two cells in the grid. And the grid of i, j should be less than or equal to 1, and should be greater than or a grid i, j should be greater than 1, but less than or equal to 100.‚Äù
